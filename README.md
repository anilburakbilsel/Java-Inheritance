## Inheritance in Java

This project is going to be an example to show you how to use Inheritance in Java (actually it is same for almost all
the Object Oriented Programming Languages).


### Tools

 You can use any text editors for this project (I would recommend you to use an IDE). I am using IntelliJ which is a
 product of Jet Brains. You can use its community edition for almost all of your personal projects. It is a great tool
 to work on Java projects. Other than that, Visual Studio Code is also a very good text editor (it's my favorite text
 editor) which you can work in any languages.
